# 🧱 Object-Oriented Programming in Python

This repository explores the fundamentals of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python through real-world code examples and problem-solving.

It demonstrates the use of classes, constructors, inheritance, method overriding, and more — all written in a clear, modular structure.

## 📘 Tasks Overview

### ✅ Task 7 - Rectangle Class
- Defined a `Rectangle` class with length and width attributes
- Implemented methods to calculate area and perimeter
- Added a `display()` method to output details

### ✅ Task 8 - Counting Instances & Deck of Cards
- Created a class that tracks its instance count
- Built a complete **Deck of Cards** using:
  - `Card` and `Deck` classes
  - Shuffle functionality
  - Deal method with card removal

### ✅ Task 9 - Inheritance & Method Overriding
- Constructed `Vehicle` and `Bus` classes with inheritance
- Overrode the `fare()` method in `Bus` to include maintenance charges
- Utilized `super()` to reuse and extend base class logic
