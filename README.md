# 🧱 Object-Oriented Programming in Python

In Week 3, I explored the fundamentals of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.  
I implemented Python classes, constructors, inheritance, method overriding, and more through practical problems.

## 📘 Tasks Overview

### ✅ Task 7 - Rectangle Class
- Created a `Rectangle` class with length and width attributes
- Added methods to calculate area and perimeter
- Built a `display()` method to show all properties

### ✅ Task 8 - Counting Instances & Deck of Cards
- Wrote a class that counts its own instances
- Designed a full-fledged **Deck of Cards** using:
  - `Card` and `Deck` classes
  - Shuffle logic
  - Deal logic removing cards

### ✅ Task 9 - Inheritance & Method Overriding
- Built `Vehicle` and `Bus` classes
- Overrode `fare()` method in `Bus` to include maintenance charges
- Practiced use of `super()` to extend base class functionality
